## 2024-05-22 - [Prompt Injection in Evaluation Scripts]
**Vulnerability:** Evaluation scripts like `custom_llm_eval.py` construct prompts using f-strings with XML-like tags (`<summary>{summary}</summary>`). Unsanitized inputs containing closing tags (e.g., `</summary>`) can break the prompt structure and inject instructions.
**Learning:** Even internal evaluation tools need input sanitization to prevent structure confusion, especially when grading potentially adversarial inputs.
**Prevention:** Always use `html.escape()` or similar sanitization on variable inputs before inserting them into XML-structured prompts.
